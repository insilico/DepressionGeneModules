### Notes

The directional RNA-Seq preprocessing in the published analysis used the forward direction for the second file, which results in enrichment of antisense RNA (RNA that is transcribed from the coding strand of DNA as opposed to the template strand). These antisense RNA reads were mapped to their partner genes and antisense expression in these genes was associated with major depressive disorder. The function of the associated genes and modules in the manuscript should then be interpreted in terms of the antisense regulation of expression.  
The two directories contain processed RNA-Seq dataset of mRNA gene expression (`secondary_expression_data/`) and the antisense expression used in the manuscript (`primary_antisense_modules/`) for 78 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 79 healthy controls (HC).

### Abstract

Genomic variation underlying major depressive disorder (MDD) likely involves the interaction and regulation of multiple genes in a network. Data-driven co-expression network module inference has the potential to account for variation within regulatory networks, reduce the dimensionality of RNA-Seq data and detect significant gene-expression modules associated with depression severity. We performed an RNA-Seq gene co-expression network analysis of mRNA data obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of unmedicated MDD (n=78) and healthy control (n=79) subjects. Across the combined MDD and HC groups, we assigned genes into modules using hierarchical clustering with a dynamic tree cut method and projected the expression data onto a lower-dimensional module space by computing the single-sample gene-set enrichment score of each module. We tested the single-sample scores of each module for association with levels of depression severity measured by the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Scale (MADRS). Independent of MDD status, we identified 23 gene modules from the co-expression network. Two modules were significantly associated with the MADRS score after multiple comparison adjustment (adjusted p=0.009, 0.028 at 0.05 FDR threshold), and one of these modules replicated in a previous RNA-Seq study of MDD (p=0.03). The two MADRS-associated modules contain genes previously implicated in mood disorders and show enrichment of apoptosis and B cell receptor signaling. The genes in these modules show a correlation between network centrality and univariate association with depression, suggesting that intramodular hub genes are more likely to be related to MDD compared to other genes in a module.
